# 3D Flappy Bird

## Overview
This is a 3D version of Flappy Bird that I built as a learning project. The game includes randomized elements to make each playthrough feel different. It helped me learn the basics of 3D game development.

## Features
- Randomized properties of pipes to make the game feel different at times.
- High score tracking.
- Collision Detection so when the bird touches a pipe or the death bounds the game ends
  
## Controls
- **Spacebar**: Flap / jump  
- **A/D**: Move the bird left or right
